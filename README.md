This has three files named:

manage.py -> It manages all other files and runs the main program of downloading, converting and uploading the converted file to aws s3 bucket with the access public key
logger.py -> It has the basic program to have logs of each task completion or errors
functions.py -> It has the function which convert xml to csv , parse of xml, aws upload, download functions
I ahve also created a unittest.py program to check whether my program is running with each possible cases in each task.
